This is a classification task in which the goal is to predict whether the student will get good grades (GPA â‰¥ 3.0) or not, based on their study habit, parental involvement, and extracurricular activities. 
In addition, the study also aims to identify which factor has the greatest influence on the student's performance.

The task is limited to only using the linear classification models. Therefore, three type of algorithm were chosen : Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LSA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).
