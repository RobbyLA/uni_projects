This is a simple dashboard created by using R programming language with the RShiny package in RStudio.

The project is about investigating the prospect of working in the IT sector in the United States from the financial point of view.

Here, we can compare the IT sector with the other sectors to see the competition. Then, a projection for near future is also provided to see the prospect, whether this sector will weaken or prosper.

Lastly, a map is also created to compare the sector's prospect in each state of the US to identify which place has the best prospect for working in the IT sector.

The data used was mostly take from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm) and were downloaded on June 4, 2023.
